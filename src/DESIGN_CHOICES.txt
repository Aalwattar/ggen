This file is here to keep track of a number of design choices that were made.
As this work depends highly on random generators and statistical properties
a number of functions were coded in a way respectful of the wanted statiscal properties.

Anyone that have questions on chosen algorithms or if an operation risk to affect the
properties of the generated graphs need to:
	-- ask an "expert" and write here the result of the discussion
	-- in the future the dev mailing list should be a good way to keep track
	of the design choices.



QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED:
	-- how to:
		-- eliminate edges from a graph without changing its properties
		-- add edges to a graph without ...

	-- are adjacency matrix and random vertex pairs the same ??
